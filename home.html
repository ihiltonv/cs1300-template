          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>In this project, I research how people interact with a microwave and create two personas and a storyboard
            based on my observations. Through interviews and observation of users, I learned that microwaves are much
            more complex than the average user requires, as most people use only two or three buttons on the microwave
            at a time.</p>
          <p>Despite the fact that people use so little of the interface, there was not much confusion with
            users regarding how to interact with the appliance, meaning that while the interface is more complex than
            necessary for most people, it remains intuitive.</p>

          <h2>Observations of a user</h2>
          <p>Generally, the user of a microwave takes the following steps:</p>
          <ol class="observationList">
            <li>Opens the door, places the food inside</li>
            <li>Presses 1 or 2 to select the desired cook time</li>
            <li>Waits for the food to cook, potentially leaving the room during this time</li>
            <li>Opens the door when the timer goes off, or right before the timer</li>
            <li>Checks to see if their food is cooked, and repeats this process until they are satisfied</li>
          </ol>

      <h2>Interview Questions:</h2>
      <ul class="questionList">
        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>1. How often do you use the microwave?</h5>
            <p>Most respondents use the microwave a couple times a week, with the most frequent using it multiple times
              per day and the least frequent using it a couple times a month.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>2. What do you cook in the microwave?</h5>
            <p>Most respondents used the microwave primarily to reheat food, with some using it for cooking small things
              such as soup or popcorn.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>3. Describe how you generally use the microwave</h5>
            <p>Respondents largely placed items on a plate or bowl before putting the food in the microwave, then
              pressing either the 1 or 2 minute button, or the add 30 second button to start the time. Some respondents
              would be sure to open the door when the time reached 1 second to avoid the beeping. Once the time is up,
              users would check if the food was hot and possibly stir and then repeat the process of heating as needed.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>4. Are there any buttons you seldom/never use?</h5>
            <p>Some respondents never used the start button, preferring the quick 1 or 2 minute cook buttons. Others
              only used the time, start, and stop buttons. No respondents reported using any buttons other than the
              number pad, start, stop, and occasionally the popcorn button.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>5. When do you decide to use the microwave over the stove?</h5>
            <p>Respondents reported using the microwave for reheating, as well as when they don't want to do dishes or
              clean up from cooking.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>6. What do you like about using the microwave?</h5>
            <p>Respondents reported liking the speed and ease of use of the microwave for quick tasks such as reheating
              food.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>5. What do you dislike about using the microwave?</h5>
            <p>Respondents disliked how you need to clear the previous time once the door was opened, believing that you
              should be able to just enter a new time without pressing clear. They also reported frustration with
              designs where you have to specify that you're entering a cook time before pressing a number. Finally,
              there were many buttons that they were unsure of their purpose and they never used.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>6. Is there anything you wish the microwave did differently?</h5>
            <p>Respondents wished that the microwave would be able to heat to a specific temperature rather than a
              specific time, and wished the microwave would clean itself.</p>

        his mid-20s. He works from home and
        doesn't do many
        social activities. Lee has trouble with the microwave's interface because he is frustrated that he cannot just
        press one button to cook for that amount of time, he must select "time cook" and then enter the number and press
        start. This persona represents the users of the interface because they are often using the microwave when they
        don't have the energy to cook something more involved.</p>

        woman who is very driven. She
        values efficiency and is uncomfortable with having free time. Quinn is annoyed because the microwave's interface
        only allows for a timed cook rather than cooking to a certain temperature, as it would be more efficient if she
        didn't have to keep checking to see if her food is heated through. Quinn represents users of the microwave's
        interface that are using it because it is quicker than heating or cooking something with a traditional stove or
        oven.</p>
